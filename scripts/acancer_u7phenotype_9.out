Loading required package: profileModel
'brglm' will gradually be superseded by the 'brglm2' R package (https://cran.r-project.org/package=brglm2), which provides utilities for mean and median bias reduction for all GLMs.
 Methods for the detection of separation and infinite estimates in binomial-response models are provided by the 'detectseparation' R package (https://cran.r-project.org/package=detectseparation).

Warning message:
In fread(phenof, header = "auto") :
  Detected 50 column names but the data has 51 columns (i.e. invalid file). Added 1 extra default column name for the first column which is guessed to be row names or an index. Use setnames() afterwards if this guess is not correct, or fix the file write command that created the file to create a valid file.
